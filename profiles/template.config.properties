# A template configuration. This file can be used as a base to configure an
# own development environment.

# Database configuration
db.driverClass=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
db.jdbcUrl=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/tcdemos?characterEncoding=UTF-8
db.user=tcdemos
db.password=tcdemos

# XMPP configuration for the tcdemos Jabber user
# xmpp.user = The loginname of the XMPP user. Must exist on the XMPP server.
# xmpp.password = The password for the XMPP user.
# xmpp.host = The hostname of the machine hosting the XMPP server.
# xmpp.port = The XMPP port to exchange messages (Default: 5222)
# xmpp.resource = The XMPP group name. Think of it as a buddy list. The system will connect to this buddy list. All
#                 members will see status changes for the configured user. This doesn't mean that all buddies will
#                 receive system messages. See mps.xmpp_system_message_receivers for information about to setup system
#                 message receivers. Sometimes this feature is called roster.
# xmpp.service_name = The logical domain name of the XMPP service. If your XMPP service is accessible (through DNS) by
#                     the same domain name configured in your XMPP service you don't need this setting. Otherwise
#                     setup your XMPP domain name here.
#                     E.g. if you have
#                     * XMPP service is accessible under foo.example.com and your XMPP JIDs should be available as
#                       user@foo.example.com you don't need this option
#                     * XMPP service is accessible under foo.example.com and your XMPP JIDs should be available as
#                       user@bar.example.com you must set this option to bar.example.com. In this case bar.example.com
#                       must be resolvable through DNS and must point to the XMPP host.
#                     See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5193236/difference-between-xmpp-servername-and-xmpp-servicename
# xmpp.subscription_mode = The behaviour of incoming messages of users not in the group defined by xmpp.resource.
#                          Available values are "accept_all", "manual" or "reject_all".
